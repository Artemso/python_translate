# Python Translator
A small Python script to google translate files or strings
1. 'languages.py' creates a json file of language codes and language names from a table I found online
1. 'translate.py' creates a link from input, makes GET request to mobile version of translate.google.com and using BeautifulSoup parses the output

## Features to add:
* read from file
* write to file
